      those who hear my words and believe in him who
      
        sent me have eternal life.
        
         They will not be judjed,but have already passed from death to life."
         
        verse 25, "The time is coming ,the time has alredy come when the dead will
        
        hear the voice of the son of God,and those 
        who hear it will come to life. "
